# OpenEduAssistant
The OpenEduAssistant personalized course intelligent assistant represents a breakthrough in the field of educational technology. This project leverages the QLoRA framework to finetune LLMs and utilizes the IPEX-LLM acceleration library to ensure efficient local deployment of LLMs, thereby creating a localized, intelligent tutoring system that operates on LLMs without requiring GPU support. Furthermore, it integrates retrieval functionalities enhanced by embedding technologies. The primary goal is to offer customized instructional and cognitive support to educators and learners, facilitated through course-related Q\&A, question generation, and the customization of teaching outlines and course PowerPoint presentations. This project not only enhances teaching efficiency but also safeguards user data privacy and intellectual property rights.
